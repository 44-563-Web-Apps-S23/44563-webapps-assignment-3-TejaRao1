    <h4>Rich Dad Poor Dad</h4>
    <p>
        Rich Dad Poor Dad is written by Robert Kayosaki. This book helps us gain Financial literacy and more insights to equity and money markets. I like this book because this book is the main reason for my interest in equities and, this helped me for proper use of money.<br>
